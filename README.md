# Simple Weapons
A simplistic, easy to work with weapon base for Garry's Mod.

Instead of trying to imitate something other people have already done a much better job of, this base focuses on keeping things as simple as possible for both the player and developers. Providing an experience that is somewhere between Half-Life 2 and DarkRP.

Acting as the 'base', this addon includes accurate recreations of the original Half-Life 2 weapons, including a crossbow and RPG that fire the exact same projectiles as their vanilla counterparts.
